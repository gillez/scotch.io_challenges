# scotch.io_challenges : Challenge 3 - creating lightsabers using an input element and CSS.

See https://scotch.io/bar-talk/code-challenge-3-css-lightsaber-checkbox

Implemented using only HTML and CSS.  No JS.
This is only a very simple attempt without the extra sound challenge (although I may add that later).
The handles are quite simple and could do with a top and bottom styling (probably a border, maybe ::before and ::after elements)

It's only tested on Chrome v64.  I haven't targetted older or other browsers, so there's no backup "background" settings, or other types of gradients for other browsers.  It's just a simple small test!
